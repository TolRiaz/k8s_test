Kubernetes Dashboard is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows users to manage applications running in the cluster and troubleshoot them, as well as manage the cluster itself.

**IMPORTANT:** Frontend side of the project is currently undergoing migration from [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) to the current version of [Angular](https://angular.io/). If you are willing to contribute or you would like to check out early version of the application check [this pull request](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/pull/3152).

## Getting Started

**IMPORTANT:** Read the [Access Control](
https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/wiki/Access-control) guide before performing any further steps. The default Dashboard deployment contains a minimal set of RBAC privileges needed to run.

To deploy Dashboard, execute following command:

```sh
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/master/src/deploy/recommended/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml
```

To access Dashboard from your local workstation you must create a secure channel to your Kubernetes cluster. Run the following command:

```sh
$ kubectl proxy
```
Now access Dashboard at:

[`http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/`](
http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/).

## Create An Authentication Token (RBAC)
To find out how to create sample user and log in follow [Creating sample user](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/wiki/Creating-sample-user) guide.

**NOTE:**
* Kubeconfig Authentication method does not support external identity providers or certificate-based authentication. 
* Dashboard can only be accessed over HTTPS
* [Heapster](https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster/) has to be running in the cluster for the metrics
and graphs to be available. Read more about it in [Integrations](
https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/wiki/Integrations) guide.
